# kvothe

“  
I have been called Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Arcane, and Kvothe Kingkiller.
I have earned those names.  
Bought and paid for them.  
But I was brought up as Kvothe.  
My father once told me it meant "to know."    
I have, of course, been called many other things.  
Most of them uncouth, although very few were unearned.  
I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings.  
I burned down the town of Trebon.  
I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life.  
I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in.  
I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day.  
I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.  
You may have heard of me.  
”
